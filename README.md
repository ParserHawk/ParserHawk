# ParserHawk

This repository contains the artifact for the ACM SIGCOMM '25 paper "ParserHawk: Hardware-aware parser generator using program synthesis".
The artifact consists of scripts to reproduce experiment results from the paper.

## Parser Synthesis using z3 solver

We leverage the z3 solver to output the target parser's behavior. 

<!-- ## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. -->

## Getting Started

### Setup

All experiments were run on CloudLab x86_64 rs630 nodes in the Massachusetts cluster, using Ubuntu 22.04. Any similar Linux x86_64 machine would suffice. Clone this repository into your home directory. 

### Installing

* Install pip: ```sudo apt update```, ```sudo apt install python3-pip```
* Install necessary python packages: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

### Executing program

* 
* Run the program (e.g., example1): ```python3 io_examples1.py```
